        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <h3>In summary, dodos went extinct becauuse they did not have the adaptations to coexist with humans and other animals, which overhunted them, severely impacting their population, and outcompeting them for resources such as food, which reduced their growth and reproduction rates. Overall, this led to the dodos quick extinction within less than a century.</h3>
